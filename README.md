RGBlend
=======

RGBlend is a social commentary game themed around the civil unrest in Eastern Europe.

You play as a bystander caught up in a protest, and have to get home whilst avoiding police, hippies, and rioters. Fortunately, you have a superpower that lets you blend in with each of these groups. Whilst blended, you can command your followers to protect you and destroy "the enemy".

Unfortunately, the more you use it, the more you become like the people you imitate. 

Can you make it home and retain enough of your own identity to be welcomed by your family?
